This plugin is supposed to be used on Kodi in conjunction with a Synology NAS running moments.
After entering your credentials in the settings of this add-on, you can login to the NAS and view all categories and albums as you would using the web interface.
This add-on only serves as a viewer for photos and videos.
This add-on was tested on a Synology DS218+ and DS216Play NAS.

Known issues:
- When viewing videos, there is no navigation bar at the bottom. Fast forward and alike do however work. It is doubtful this will be resolved as it seems Kodi itself is having difficulties with mixed video/image content.

How to:
- Download the repository as a zip, using the button above. In Kodi choose to install from zip file and select the zip file you just downloaded.
